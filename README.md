# Cloud Resume Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for the Cloud Resume Challenge, a project showcasing skills in web development and cloud hosting. The resume is designed using HTML with styling generated by AI, and it is deployed on AWS services to demonstrate a secure and scalable cloud-based solution.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to create a personal resume as a static website, hosted on AWS. This setup highlights skills in front-end web development and cloud infrastructure by leveraging AWS S3, CloudFront, and Route 53 for deployment and management.

## Key Files and Directories

- **`index.html`**: Contains the HTML structure, content, and styling for the resume. The styling was generated using AI and is embedded directly within the HTML, so no separate CSS file is included.

## Source Control

This project is managed with Git and hosted on GitHub to maintain version control. Using source control allows for easy tracking of changes, collaborative updates, and deployment integration. Each change to the frontend code is committed and pushed to this GitHub repository, ensuring that updates are versioned and easily reversible if needed.

## JavaScript

The resume includes a visitor counter feature implemented with JavaScript. This functionality:
- Sends requests to a backend API to retrieve and display the current visitor count.
- Updates the count displayed on the resume page each time the page is loaded.

## Deployment on AWS

### Steps Completed

1. **Created HTML with Embedded Styling**  
   - Developed `index.html` with content structure and styling generated by AI.

2. **Configured AWS S3 for Static Website Hosting**  
   - Created an S3 bucket to host the HTML file, enabling public access for static website hosting.

3. **Set Up CloudFront for HTTPS**  
   - Configured a CloudFront distribution to securely serve the S3 content over HTTPS.
   - Used AWS Certificate Manager to generate an SSL/TLS certificate, enabling secure access through HTTPS.

4. **Linked Custom Domain with Route 53**  
   - Configured a custom domain in Route 53, pointing it to the CloudFront distribution.
   - Verified the domain with the registrar (e.g., Namecheap) to ensure active DNS functionality.

### Deployment Instructions

To deploy or update the frontend on AWS:

1. **Upload Files to S3**:  
   - Deploy `index.html` to an AWS S3 bucket with static website hosting enabled.

2. **Set Up CloudFront**:  
   - Attach the S3 bucket as the origin for the CloudFront distribution and apply the SSL/TLS certificate from AWS Certificate Manager to enable HTTPS.

3. **Configure DNS with Route 53**:  
   - In Route 53, set up a hosted zone for the custom domain and create an alias record pointing to the CloudFront distribution.

## Additional Information

- **Security**: HTTPS is enabled through CloudFront and AWS Certificate Manager, ensuring secure access to the resume.
- **Domain Management**: The custom domain (e.g., `samuelnielsen.com`) is managed through Route 53, allowing a professional, easy-to-remember URL.
